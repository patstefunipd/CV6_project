**Introduction:**
This project is a computer vision system for analyzing video footage of "Eight Ball" billiard matches. The system processes video clips to identify and track billiard balls on the table, distinguishing between the cue ball, the black "8-ball", solid colored balls, and striped balls. The results are displayed as a 2D top-view minimap that updates with each frame to show the positions and trajectories of the balls.
